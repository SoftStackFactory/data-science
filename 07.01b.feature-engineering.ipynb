Final tip\n","\n","Not all of the features you engineer need to be winners. \n","* In fact, you'll often find that many of them do not add much value to your model. That's OK. \n","* One highly predictive feature makes up for 10 duds, or a thing that fails to work properly or is otherwise unsatisfactory or worthless.\n","\n","The key is choosing machine learning algorithms that can effectively select the best features among many options (**built-in feature selection**). This will allow you to avoid overfitting your model despite providing many input features. \n","\n","In addition we can always come back and re-perform data cleaning and feature engineering after we look at the models accuracy and precision. In fact we will be able to find out which features had bigger weights after we have made models. After we learn which features had bigger weights we can come back and rethink how to make a more accurate model. \n","\n","We'll cover this in the next module!\n","\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center; margin: 40px 0 40px 0;\">\n","    \n","[**Back to Contents**](#toc)\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ypx6Z6hMljPE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<br>\n","\n","## Next Steps\n","\n","Congratulations for making through the Feature Engineering module!\n","\n","As a reminder, here are a few things you did in this module:\n","* You made several indicator features from domain knowledge.\n","* You created the interaction feature <code style=\"color:steelblue\">'property_age'</code>.\n","* You grouped sparse classes in the <code style=\"color:steelblue\">'exterior_walls'</code> and <code style=\"color:steelblue\">'roof'</code> features.\n","* And you encoded dummy variables and saved the final analytical base table.\n","* You dropped <code style=\"color:steelblue\">'tx_price'</code> and <code style=\"color:steelblue\">'year_built'</code> from your dataset.\n","* You exported the analytical base DataFrame and target DataFrame \n","\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align:center; margin: 40px 0 40px 0;\">\n","    \n","[**Back to Contents**](#toc)\n","</div>"]}]}
