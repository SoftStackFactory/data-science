It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n","\n","#### Topics Covered:\n","- [Violin Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html)\n","    - A violin plot plays a similar role as a box and whisker plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared. Unlike a box plot, in which all of the plot components correspond to actual datapoints, the violin plot features a kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution\n","- [Swarm Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.swarmplot.html)\n","    - This function is similar to [stripplot()](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.stripplot.html), but the points are adjusted (only along the categorical axis) so that they don’t overlap. This gives a better representation of the distribution of values, but it does not scale well to large numbers of observations. This style of plot is sometimes called a “beeswarm”\n","- [Strip Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.stripplot.html)\n","    - Also known as a Categorical Scatter Plot, a Strip Plot is used when one of the variable under study is categorical. It represents the data in sorted order along any one of the axis.\n","- [Density Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.stripplot.html)\n","    - A density plot is a smoothed, continuous version of a histogram estimated from the data. \n","    - The most common form of estimation is known as kernel density estimation (KDE). In this method, a continuous curve (the kernel) is drawn at every individual data point and all of these curves are then added together to make a single smooth density estimation. The kernel most often used is a Gaussian (which produces a Gaussian bell curve at each data point). \n","- [sns.set](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.set.html)\n","    - Used to set aesthetic parameters directly or temporarily"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kQDNb29biYvv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##### Violin Plot\n","\n","Violin plots plots try to give an indication of the distribution of data without cluttering the plot by drawing all of the points. They do this by using kernel density estimation (KDE) to model the distribution. There is a lot of information to process in a violin plot so they can be a bit tough to read. The shape of the violin body indicates the number of observations: if the violin is thick at some value it means there are a lot of data points there, if it is thin then there are few. The inside of the violin is often marked to indicate additional information. The violins below have the quartiles draw inside them as dashed lines, but miniature box plots are another common inner marking."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hizFhzOxiYvx","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Violin Plot Example\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from matplotlib import pyplot \n","\n","# Load the example iris dataset\n","iris = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\n","\n","# Set params\n","fig, ax = pyplot.subplots(figsize =(9, 7)) \n","\n","# Plot Violin\n","sns.violinplot(ax = ax, x=iris[\"species\"], y=iris[\"sepal_length\"])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nH-tY0YuiYv4","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##### Swarm Plot\n","\n","Swarm Plots, also called beeswarm plots, are similar to strip plots in that they plot all of the data points. Unlike strip plots, swarm plots attempt to avoid obscuring points by calculating non-overlapping positions instead of adding random jitter. This sort of gives them appearance of a swarm of bees, or perhaps a honeycomb.\n","\n","Swarm plots share many of the same advantages of strip plots, but without as much clutter to hide their salient features. Unfortunately, spreading out the points in a non-overlapping fashion limits the number of points that can be plotted—there is only so much space on the page! Additionally, the algorithm that calculates the positions is computationally expensive and so scales poorly as the number of points increases."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ad1OiFH8iYv5","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Swarm Plot Example\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","# Set aesthetic parameters\n","sns.set(style=\"whitegrid\", palette=\"muted\")\n","\n","# Load the example iris dataset\n","iris = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\n","\n","# Plot Swarmplot\n","sns.swarmplot(x=\"species\", y=\"sepal_length\",\n","              palette=[\"r\", \"c\", \"y\"], data=iris)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EzbrTZ-1iYwA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##### Strip Plot\n","\n","Strip Plots, also called dot plots or univariate dot plots, try to give us a little—well a lot—more information than box plots.

The density of points also gives an approximation of the underlying distribution, although this can be hard to judge by eye because the distance in the categorical axis, while meaningless, obscures the true distance between points.
